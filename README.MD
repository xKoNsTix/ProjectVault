## What is this? 

An HCI Project in combination with the subject "Creative Making and Digital Fabrication"
The goal is to create an interactive Prototype which responds to motion in form of motion or light.

Since i tend to lose my keys, i decided to create a dedicated "key vault".
It consists of 2 primary sensors: A proximity sensor and a motions sensor. 

The motion sensor is used to visualize the status of the vault. The vault will respond with 
green lights if something is in it, and with red if not. 

The Proximity sensor acts as the opener, when an object comes near vault, vault will open.
The code for this is found in this repo. Since i have programmed timings and delays, i used a second ardui

At the time of writing this, vault is currently printed, or at least, the housing of it.
